I made a script to explore the idea of managing the entire schedule as a list of the things that you have to do as a list.
Entries are made in the file itself and can be out of order. 
The display function orders them by date in reverse so the list is read from the bottem upwards, which is good for reading it from the command line.
Past entries are ignored for this ouput.

The script also outputs all entries (none are ignored) to a csv file for opening as a spreadsheet.
